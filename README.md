Box Dungeon is a platformer with bullet hell aspects. You jump around from room to room on top of tiles and moving platforms, all while avoiding the abounded spikes which like to hide when out of sight and the constant raining asalt of fire balls. There are 4 levels, each level has 4 rooms. There are 5 different difficultys so you can make the game as hard as you want it to be.
